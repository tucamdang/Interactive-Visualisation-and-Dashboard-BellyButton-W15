In this assignment, we build interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, refers to the microbes that colonise human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

As index.html and data samples (samples.json) provided, we edit/code the app.js to display the chart - information:

There are three charts which will be presented, one table to demonstrate each key-value: 
1. Now we can apply the D3 library to read in samples.json

2. To generate a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- Edit ``sample_values`` as the values in bar chart.
- Edit ``otu_ids`` as the labels in bar chart.
- Edit ``otu_labels`` as the hovertext in chart.

3. We generate a bubble chart that displays each sample.
- Edit ``otu_ids`` for the x values, ``sample_values`` for the y values.
- Edit ``sample_values`` for the marker size, ``otu_ids`` for the marker colours.
- Edit ``otu_labels`` for the text values.

4. Demonstrate the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. In the Bonus section:
By using the provided link, Gauge Chart from https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/ to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
We can apply example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 to 9.

The overall dashboard can be looked like this:
